terraform
-------------
argument= whatever we will give within the blocks 

output.tf = To print the created resource output data

diff b/w argument and attribute
-----------------------------
inputs which are given in block ---argument --- inputs

we will give which are to be printed as output-- attribute-- outputs

variable.tf
---------------
we declare values which are to be going to insert in argument
variables declaration

tfvars (we will pass original values for variables here)
--------
it contains values of variables

main.tf
---------
it contains cloud provider details and region details


--> Terraform by default will take only terraform files

--> if u want give values through tfvars file then u mention manually

 ex:- terraform apply -var-file=dev.tfvars

if u want to take automatically, then save filename with auto.tfvars 

 ex:- auto.tfvars

Datasource (to read and create)
-----------

it is used to take id of already created resource

suppose:- if u create vpc before , now u want to create subnet
  at that time u call vpc id to create subnet, so we use Datasource.

module (total code contains resource.tf,main.tf,variable.tf,output.tf,tfvars)
-----------
 
it is used to reuse of the entire code, by changing the tfvars file values
